Title: Auto Convert Word Doc to a PDF file. Uses the FREE Win2PDF.com application.
Description: Hi Groovy People!
This is the source to an EXE that uses Win2PDF to create a PDF file from a Word Document - completely in the background.
Win2PDF is FREE for personal use. And it is cheap to buy.
It is the sort of thing that will increase your VB Consultancy income!
What their app does, is it lets you PRINT any document to a PDF file. There is also a demo VB Script to do the Printer.Print lark! 
HOWEVER, there are NO SUPPORTING SAMPLES for converting DOC files.
I mean, at least from a VB developer's stand point.
So, I wrote this COMMAND LINE (Shellable) version!
It is completely unique.
Enjoy, and please do VOTE if you like it. I hope that by adding this skill to your development repertoire, you can increase your own consultancy income. 
Good luck!
Cheers,
Kevin
