Hi  People!

One of my customers needed me to create PDF's from Word Documents.
Because they already used a cheap (under $40) application called:
Win2PDF application (100% FREE for Personal use) from:


Well, it works a treat. 

What it does, is it lets you PRINT any document to a PDF file.
There is also a demo VB Script to do the Printer.Print lark!
HOWEVER - there are NO SUPPORTING SAMPLES for converting DOC files.
I mean - at least from a VB developer's stand point.

So, I wrote this COMMAND LINE (Shellable) version!

Enjoy - and please do VOTE if you like it. I hope that by adding
this skill to your development repertoire, you can increase your
own consultancy income. Good luck!

Cheers,
Kamlesh Mishra
